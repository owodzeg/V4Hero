worldmap_location_2_description|The pine trees in this grove are well-known for their gargantuan height and sturdiness when used as a building material. Patapon lumberjacks are known to make a living here by cutting down these trees to use for construction. Rumor has it that fairies thrive off of the edible mushrooms within the depths of the forest.

worldmap_location_3_description|Ejiji Cliffs once saw the age of mighty dragons before they disappeared from their place of birth for reasons unknown to Rolitoland's inhabitants, and provides a good spot for building homes and fortresses hidden from plain sight alike. Gyaba Rarepons originate from this region and some still inhabit the cliffs to this day, but many of these Patapon lines have since then become widespread around the world.
