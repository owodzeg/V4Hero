worldmap_location_1_title|~ Shida Valley ~
worldmap_location_1_description|The humid sea air blowing into this valley makes for a perfect habitat for plants of all kinds, allowing the native ferns to grow to tremendous heights! For generations, various tribes have used this fertile area as a place to hunt animals and gather wild vegetables. It's strange landscape of giant plants can be disorienting, and rumours persist of hidden secrets somewhere in the region.
worldmap_location_2_title|~ Patapine Grove ~
worldmap_location_2_description|The pine trees in this grove are well-known for their gargantuan height and sturdiness when used as a building material. Patapon lumberjacks are known to make a living here by cutting down these trees to use for construction. Rumor has it that fairies thrive off of the edible mushrooms within the depths of the forest.
worldmap_location_3_title|~ Ejiji Cliffs ~
worldmap_location_3_description|Ejiji Cliffs once saw the age of mighty dragons before they disappeared from their place of birth for reasons unknown to Rolitoland's inhabitants, and provides a good spot for building homes and fortresses hidden from plain sight alike. Gyaba Rarepons originate from this region and some still inhabit the cliffs to this day, but many of these Patapon lines have since then become widespread around the world.
worldmap_mission_1_title|Hunting in Shida Valley
worldmap_mission_1_description|Many animals gather in the valley for a chance to find edible plants and fungi. Use this opportunity to hunt the creatures to feed your Patapons! Rumors say that the valley holds an unknown treasure.

According to the reports, the to-be fortress is reinforced with powerful Kirajin technology, the likes of which the Patapons have never seen before. Be brave and be fearless, and destroy this fortress before it's complete.
worldmap_mission_5_title|Relentless Kirajins at Ejiji Cliffs: Lv. 
worldmap_mission_5_description|Even after destroying their fortress once, the Kirajins will not allow themselves to lose again. They’re determined to fight for this location even if it costs them their lives. Meden warns with a grim tone in her voice, “This will be even tougher than the last battle”.
worldmap_mission_6_title|Snow-covered Ferns of Shida Valley
worldmap_mission_6_description|In this time of the year, Shida Valley gets covered in snow, as the freezing winds from the ocean near the Patapole Bridge are coming. That's a perfect opportunity for rare animals to come out from their nests and hunt for fish under the ice. Sometimes, really rare species can show up...

// ## INTRO CUTSCENE

newgame_intro_2|In this unfamiliar place, we discovered\the ruins of an ancient civilization,\seemingly long forgotten.
newgame_intro_3|Desperate to find IT, we began tinkering\with the ancient mechanisms that\were found buried within the rubble.
newgame_intro_4|With a single button press, our three Yaripons,\Hero, and myself, were sent to an bizarre\and unfamiliar location filled with nature\and wildlife, seemingly devoid of any civilization.
newgame_intro_5|Worried about our comrades, we attempted\everything we could to return back home,\and thank the Almighty Patapon that we succeeded!
newgame_intro_6|However...
newgame_intro_7|Upon our return, we came back to discover\the bodies of our allies. Judging by\their wounds, their deaths were recent.
newgame_intro_8|The sky above was dyed bloody red,\and the screams of the very few survivors\could be heard in the distance.
newgame_intro_9|We looked up to the skies and were met with\a terrifying yet mysterious figure floating\ominously above us. It's singular eye was\filled with resentment and hatred.
newgame_intro_10|As it began to approach us, we luckily saved ourselves\with the ancient machine we had used once before,\barely escaping the despairing jaws of death.
newgame_intro_11|...
newgame_intro_12|Almighty, I pray to you!\Please guide us to Earthend.
newgame_intro_13|Save our world from evil\and let us finally gaze upon IT!
